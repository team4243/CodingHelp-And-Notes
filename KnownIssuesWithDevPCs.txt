1.- Sleep & hibernate are broken in windows 10 on both machines. System will go into sleep mode fine, but then come out with a BSOD.
    Computer has been made to not sleep/hibernate on its own, and the option to do it manually has been removed from the start menu. 
	-Likely Issue: Windows can't figure out the dual GPU config. (Intel integrated & Quadro), BSOD error was Video_Memory_Management_Internal
	 or something similar.
2.- Brightness controls (Fn+arrowup/down) do not work in windows, however the on battery and on charger brightness can be set in BIOS
   (Press F2 at Dell POST screen).
	-Likely Issue: Drivers...
3.- 802.11 n wifi doesn't work reliably and cuts out every ~10 minutes. Wifi card has been forced to use 802.11 a/b/g to have reliability at a
    sacrifice of speed.
	-Likely Issue: Drivers...
