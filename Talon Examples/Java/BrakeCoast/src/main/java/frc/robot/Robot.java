/**
 * Description:
 * The BrakeCoast example demonstrates Talon SRX's/Victor SPX's ability to change
 * neutral mode between Brake and Coast.
 * 
 * Neutral mode can be determined by LED state of B/C Button on either Motor Controller (MC).
 * 	- Brake Mode: LED On
 * 	- Coast Mode: LED Off
 * 
 * Two methods to toggle between Brake and Coast
 * 1.) Use setNeutralMode() to perform software override on MC's neutral Mode.
 * 2.) Use Hardware B/C button on MC to toggle neutral mode state. 
 * 	Only works if setNeutralMode() has not been called in current program 
 * 	(software override prevents hardware B/C button from changing MC's neutral Mode);
 * 
 * Controls:
 * Button 1: Toggle between Coast and Brake, 
 * 	- Indicated by print to DriverStation and LED color of B/C LED/Button on MC
