/**
 * Description:
 * The DriveStraight_Pigeon example demonstrates the ability to get telemetry on orientation 
 * from Pigeon and perform Straight Drive Servo-ing. This is done by providing more/less output
 * on either the left or right side of the robot based on the error between desired yaw and 
 * current yaw. The project is basic PID Controller done in the roboRIO on Pigeon Yaw.
 *
 * If Pigeon is present on CANbus, or ribbon-cabled to a CAN-Talon, the robot will use the IMU to servo.
 * If Pigeon is not present, robot will simply apply the same throttle to both sides.
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * This is different from DriveStraight_AuxPigeon in that this project does not use 
 * the auxiliary feature, therfore performing the Closed Loop on Yaw in the RIO rather
 * than in the the motor controller. 
 * 
 * Controls:
 * Button 5: When held, start and run Pigeon straight drive, holding the angle the robot was 
 * 	in when the button was initally pressed during the entire hold duration.
 * Left Joystick Y-Axis: Drive robot forward and reverse.
 * Right Joystick X-Axis: 
 * 	+ Normal mode: When Button 5 is released, turn robot left and right.
 * 	+ Pigeon Straight Drive: When Button 5 is held, do nothing. Maintain current heading/yaw
 * 
 * When developing robot applications with IMUs, it's important to design in what happens if
 * the IMU is disconnected or un-powered.
 * 
 * Supported Version:
 * 	- Talon SRX: 4.0
 * 	- Victor SPX: 4.0
 * 	- Pigeon IMU: 4.0
 * 	- CANifier: 4.0
