/**
 * Description:
 * Simple example for plotting sensor
 * Sensor is a CTRE Magnetic Encoder plugged into a Talon SRX via Gadgeteer Ribbon Cable.
 * Robot should be propped up on blocks so that the wheels spin free (if testing a drive train sensor).
 * 
 * Talon SRX: 			http://www.ctr-electronics.com/talon-srx.html
 * Magnetic Encoder: 	http://www.ctr-electronics.com/srx-magnetic-encoder.html
 * Cables: 				http://www.ctr-electronics.com/talon-srx-data-cable-4-pack.html
 * 						http://www.ctr-electronics.com/talon-srx-data-cable-kit-new-product.html
 * 
 * SmartDashboard (SD) setup.
 * [1] Open Smartdashboard (I typically (re)select the Dashboard Type in DriverStation if the SD doesn't pop up).
 * [2] Deploy software and enable.
 * [3] Find the text entry in the SD for "vel".  
 * [4] View =>Editable should be checked.
 * [5] Right-click on "vel" label and "Change to..." the Line Plot.  
 * 
 * A few details regarding Smartdashboard in general...
 * [1] Constant data does not render new plot points. So if the signal being measured doesn't 
 * 	change value, the plot stops. Once the signal changes again the plot resumes but the time 
 * 	gap between is truncated in the plot.
 * 
 * [2] Changing the window of samples is done by View=>Editable=>Check, then right 
 * 	click-properties on the plot. Then change "Buffer Size" in the popup.I find myself 
 * 	changing this often as I learn more about the signal I am viewing.
 * 
 * [3] Zoom features will cause the plot to stop updating and I haven't found a quick way to
 * 	get the plot to resume plotting.  So I've been avoiding Zoom-In/Zoom-Out for now.
 * 
 * [4] Right-click properties on the plot does different things depending on if 
 * 	View=>Editable is checked.
 *  
 * Controls:
 * Button 1: When held, apply 25 percent output forward on Talon SRX. 
 * 	Victor SPX will follow due to configuration.
 * 
 * Supported Version:
 * - Talon SRX: 4.0
 * - Victor SPX: 4.0
 * - Pigeon IMU: 4.0
 * - CANifier: 4.0
