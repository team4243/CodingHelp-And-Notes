/**
 * Description:
 * This Java FRC robot application is meant to demonstrate an example using the Motion Profile control mode
 * in Talon SRX.  The TalonSRX class gives us the ability to buffer up trajectory points and execute them
 * as the roboRIO streams them into the Talon SRX.
 * 
 * There are many valid ways to use this feature and this example does not sufficiently demonstrate every possible
 * method.  Motion Profile streaming can be as complex as the developer needs it to be for advanced applications,
 * or it can be used in a simple fashion for fire-and-forget actions that require precise timing.
 * 
 * This application is a TimedRobot project to demonstrate a minimal implementation not requiring the command 
 * framework, however these code excerpts could be moved into a command-based project.
 * 
 * The project also includes instrumentation.java which simply has debug printfs, and a MotionProfile.java which is generated
 * in @link https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PgT10EeQiR92LNXEOEe3VGn737P7WDP4t0CQxQgC8k0/edit#gid=1813770630&vpid=A1
 * or find Motion Profile Generator.xlsx in the Project folder.
 * 
 * Controls:
 * Button 5: When held, initialize motion pofile. Send Motion Profile to Talon while it is nuetral.
 * Button 6: If Button 5 is held, press to run motion profile, else do nothing. 
 * 	Hold final Motion Profile point until Motion Profile is fired again (Press Button 6 again)
 * Left Joystick Y-Axis: Throttle Talon SRX forward and reverse when no buttons are pressed.
 * 
 * Gains for Motion Profile may need to be adjusted in Constants.java
