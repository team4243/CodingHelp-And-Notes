/**
 * Description:
 * Helpful examle explaining WPI's motor safety feature.
 * The goal is to auto-neutral your motors if your application stops calling set().
 *
 * Motor safety features can be a trap for teams where:
 *  - They unknowingly rely on this because they don't explicitly turn off motors at end of auton.
 *      Then when they disable it to workaround a problem, auton robot drives into a wall.
 *  - This can potentioally cause erroneuos motor disables due to intermittent
 *       lags in loop time (historically caused by excessive printing, logging, or competition WiFi lag).
 * 
 * Some tips:
 * - Always have a team member ready to disable the robot via Driver Station!
 * - Neutral your motor outputs explicitly in your disabled loop.
 * - Ensure you set motor output to zero when actions are complete.
 * - Use motor safety in contexts that makes sense, i.e. during source-level breakpoint/debugging.
 * 
 * Controls:
 * Left Joystick Y-Axis: Drive robot in forward and reverse direction
 * Right Joystick X-Axis: Turn robot in right and left direction
 * Button 1: Stops updating the drive train.  If safeties are on, this should neutral the motor and trigger
 *      a Driver Station message. If safeties are off MOTORS WILL CONTINUE LAST COMMAND.
