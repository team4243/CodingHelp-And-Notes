 * Description:
 * The PigeonRemoteSensor example demonstrates:
 *  - how to get values from a PigeonIMU and
 *  - how to to use a PigeonIMU as a remote sensor
 * Tested with Logitech F350 USB Gamepad inserted into Driver Station
 * 
 * Be sure to configure the correct motor controller and pigeon
 * The example has all the tools needed to determine if the pigeon is in a good
 * position on the robot i.e. it will measure the desired values under all
 * circumstances the robot will experience.
 * 
 * The first thing you should do is determine if the placement of the pigeon is
 * close enough to the center of rotation - The Pigeon IMU is a sensor that is
 * impacted by excessive and sustained g-forces. Keeping it near the center of
 * rotation will prevent this excessive and sustained g-force while the robot is
 * rotating. The procedure for this is as follows: 1. Drive the robot into an
 * immovable flat obstacle, such as a wall 2. Zero the yaw and accumZ by
 * pressing the A button 3. Drive the robot in a zero turn at max speed for
 * about 30 seconds 4. Drive the robot in the opposite direction for about 30
 * seconds or until yaw is around 0 5. Drive back up to the immovable object,
 * and measure the yaw value and accum Z value 6. If yaw is incorrect and accumZ
 * is correct, move the IMU closer to Centor of rotation and repeat
 * 
 * The second thing you should do is temperature-calibrate the pigeon - Follow
 * the guide in the documentation Bring-Up Pigeon for this
 * https://phoenix-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ch11_BringUpPigeon.html#temperature-calibration
 * 
 * A quick guide on how to temperature calibrate is below: 1. Ensure pigeon is
 * cool before beginning temperature calibration. This can be confirmed with a
 * self test 2. Enter temperature calibration mode. This is done either using
 * the API or using Phoenix Tuner 3. Heat the pigeon. 4. Once the pigeon has
 * seen a sufficient range of temperatures, it will momentarily blink green,
 * then cleanly boot-calibrate.
 * 
 * Controls:
 * X, B Buttons: Cycle between yaw, pitch, and roll as the selected filter for the motor controller
 * A Button: Zero yaw
 * Y Button: Start printing information every 50 loops
 * Left, Right Bumpers: Cycle between printing YPR information, and any other information pigeon has
 * Left joystick up/down: Throttle for the Robot
 * Right joystick left/right: Turn for the Robot
